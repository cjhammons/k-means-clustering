# K-means algorithm
This repo is a relic from an AI class I took in Fall of 2016 at Auburn University. The assignment was to take a set of points (located in A.txt) and classify them using the k-means algorithm.

Red, blue, and green indicate distinct clusters. The black dots are centroids. This was also my first time using a plotting library with Java, and I was crunched for time so I never labeled the graph.

### Dear AI Students:
Don't copy my homework, do your own work you lazy bum.
